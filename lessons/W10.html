      <h2> Notes</h2>
      <p>
        We have our code in the following codepen repository: <a href="https://plnkr.co/plunk/o4FxeMedyMm2xqgp">Week 10
          - Team Activity</a> <br>
        Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in
        the correct format. <br>
        This is called client-side form validation <br>
        Go to any popular site with a registration form, and you will notice that they provide feedback when you don't
        enter your data in the format they are expecting. <br>
        There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll encounter on the web: <br>
        1) Built-in form validation <br>
        2) JavaScript <br>
        Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, which expects a Regular Expression as its value.
        <br>
        The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as
        requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch
        resources asynchronously across the network. <br>
        The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() <br>
        The most common response properties you'll use are: <br>

        Response.status — An integer (default value 200) containing the response status code. <br>
        Response.statusText — A string (default value "OK"), which corresponds to the HTTP status code message. <br>
        Response.ok — seen in use above, this is a shorthand for checking that status is in the range 200-299 inclusive.
        This returns a Boolean. <br>
      </p>

      <h2> Questions?</h2>
      <p> What is the diferrence between AJAX and Node js?</p>
      <h2> Code Example</h2>
      <code> import QuakesController from '../controllers/QuakesController.js'; <br>
        import { getJSON, getLocation } from '../js/utilities.js'; <br>
            getLocation().then(data => { <br>
            const latitude = data.coords.latitude; <br>
            const longitude = data.coords.longitude; <br>
            const position = { <br>
                lat: latitude, <br>
                lon: longitude <br>
            }
            console.log(position); <br>
            const quakesController = new QuakesController("#quakeList", position); <br>
            console.log(quakesController); <br>
            quakesController.init(); <br>
            quakesController.getQuakesByRadius(500); <br>
        });
