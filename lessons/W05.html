        <h2> Notes</h2>
        <p>
          We have our code in the following codepen repository: <a href="https://plnkr.co/edit/LrqGBhOoVbZYIMrm?open=lib%2Fscript.js">WDD 05 - Team Activity</a> <br>
          As programmers, we often have little influence over how external systems work, so it can be difficult to fix the root cause of system errors.<br>
          An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. <br>
          An exception will also produce astack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. <br>
          A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. <br>
          JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors; it didn’t implement exceptions at all until ECMAScript version 3. Instead of alerting a user to an error in a program, it just failed silently in the background, and this is sometimes still the case.  <br>
          'use strict';  ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.<br>
          Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. <br>
          </p>

        <h2> Questions?</h2> 
        <p>  What is the difference between an exception with and error.</p>
        <h2> Code Example</h2>
        <code>import {hikesContrller} from './app/controllers/hikesController.js'; <br>
          const ctrl = new hikesContrller(); <br>
          ctrl.render();
        </code>
