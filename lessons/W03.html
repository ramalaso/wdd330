        <h2> Notes</h2>
        <p>
          We have our code in the following codepen repository: <a href="https://codepen.io/ramalaso/pen/BaoYjqQ?editors=1011">WDD 03 - Team Activity</a>
          If a property's values is a function, it is known as a method. <br>
          Each property is a key value pair, separated by commas. <br>
          All objects are mutable when the program is running. <br>
          Objects can inherit properties from other objects. <br>
          An object can contain another object <br>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page <br>
          Every id attribute should be unique to just one element <br>
          The document.querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to find
the first element <br>
Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a
key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then
respond to <br>

        <h2> Questions?</h2> 
        <p>When can I use stringify method if an JSON file is already a string? </p>
        <h2> Code Example</h2>
        <code>// 5. Sort the inventors by years lived</code> <br>
        <code>result = inventors.sort((a, b) => {
          return (a.passed - a.year) - (b.passed - b.year);
         }); <br>
         console.log("Inventors sorted by years lived :"); <br>
         console.table(result);</code>
