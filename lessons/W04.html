        <h2> Notes</h2>
        <p>
          We have our code in the following codepen repository: <a href="https://codepen.io/ramalaso/pen/QWjBqzd">WDD 04 - Team Activity</a> <br>
          Forms are made up of a form element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. <br>
          Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code. <br>
          The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document. <br>
          Form objects have a number of useful properties and methods that can be used to interact with the form. <br>
          Forms trigger a number of events like those discussed in the last chapter. Some of these events are exclusive to forms. <br>
          Other types of form controls: Input Fields, Text Input Fields, Password Input Fields, Checkbox Input Fields, Radio Button Input Fields, Hidden Input Fields,  File Input Fields, Other Input Types. <br>
          Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. <br>
          Encapsulation: In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to knowhowitâ€™s done. <br>
          Polymorphism: this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation<br>
          Inheritance:  we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods. <br>
          </p>

        <h2> Questions?</h2> 
        <p>Why prototype inheritance is so different to inheritance with classes? </p>
        <h2> Code Example</h2>
        <code>const winner = (mark) => { <br>
          container.classList.add('finish'); <br>
          hasWinner = true; <br>
          document.getElementById('winner').innerText = "Winner: " + mark; <br>
      }</code>
