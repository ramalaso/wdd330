      <h2> Notes</h2>
      <p>
        We have our code in the following codepen repository: <a href="https://plnkr.co/edit/HvhEJ2bujEhjmVlC?open=lib%2Fscript.js">WDD 09 - Team Activity</a> <br>
        Every JavaScript environment has aglobal object. <br>
        The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. <br>
        Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program <br>
        The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box<br>
        It’s worth reiterating again that these methods will stop the execution of a program in its tracks. <br>
        The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the user’s browser. <br>
        A new window can be opened using the window.open() method.  <br>
        ach window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.  <br>
        Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. <br>
        HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used to create web pages. <br>
        .The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.  <br>
        The support for the data- attribute is generally very good in modern browsers. <br>
        The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.  <br>
        Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript.  <br>
        We start by preventing the form from being submitted, then display a message that says 'This could take a while ...'.  <br>
      </p>

      <h2> Questions?</h2> 
      <p> Is there a way to save data in LocalStorage but in different navigators like Edge and Chrome for instance?</p>
      <h2> Code Example</h2>
      <code> function playSound(e) { <br>
        var keys = [65, 83, 68, 70, 71, 72, 74, 75, 76]; <br>
        console.log(keys.includes(e.keyCode)); <br>
        //If the key is a valid one <br>
        if (keys.includes(e.keyCode)) { <br>
          index = keys.indexOf(e.keyCode); <br>
          times[index]++; <br>
          if (times[index] == 10) {<br>
            times[index] = 0; <br>
          } <br>
        
          let element = document.querySelector(`[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`); <br>
          element.style.position = 'relative'; <br>
          element.style.left = '0px'; <br>
          element.style.top = '0px'; <br>
          element.style.top = parseInt(element.style.top) + 10 * times[index] + 'px'; <br>
          console.log(times); <br>
          let audio = document.querySelector('#audio' + e.keyCode); <br>
          audio.currentTime = 0; <br>
          console.dir(audio); <br>
          audio.play(); <br>
        } <br>
      } <br>
