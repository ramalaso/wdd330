      <h2> Notes</h2>
      <p>
        We have our code in the following codepen repository: <a href="https://plnkr.co/edit/HvhEJ2bujEhjmVlC?open=lib%2Fscript.js">WDD 09 - Team Activity</a> <br>
        Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. <br>
        This is called client-side form validation <br>
        Go to any popular site with a registration form, and you will notice that they provide feedback when you don't enter your data in the format they are expecting. <br>
        There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll encounter on the web: <br>
        1) Built-in form validation <br>
        2) JavaScript <br>
        Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, which expects a Regular Expression as its value. <br>
        The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network. <br>
        The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() <br>
        The most common response properties you'll use are: <br>

        Response.status — An integer (default value 200) containing the response status code. <br>
        Response.statusText — A string (default value "OK"), which corresponds to the HTTP status code message. <br>
        Response.ok — seen in use above, this is a shorthand for checking that status is in the range 200-299 inclusive. This returns a Boolean. <br>

      <h2> Code Example</h2>
      <code> function playSound(e) { <br>
        var keys = [65, 83, 68, 70, 71, 72, 74, 75, 76]; <br>
        console.log(keys.includes(e.keyCode)); <br>
        //If the key is a valid one <br>
        if (keys.includes(e.keyCode)) { <br>
          index = keys.indexOf(e.keyCode); <br>
          times[index]++; <br>
          if (times[index] == 10) {<br>
            times[index] = 0; <br>
          } <br>
        
          let element = document.querySelector(`[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`); <br>
          element.style.position = 'relative'; <br>
          element.style.left = '0px'; <br>
          element.style.top = '0px'; <br>
          element.style.top = parseInt(element.style.top) + 10 * times[index] + 'px'; <br>
          console.log(times); <br>
          let audio = document.querySelector('#audio' + e.keyCode); <br>
          audio.currentTime = 0; <br>
          console.dir(audio); <br>
          audio.play(); <br>
        } <br>
      } <br>
